Introduction
Backups are an important part of any system. Kubernetes is no exception. Kubernetes has distributed key-value store called etcd, used as Kubernetes’ backing store for all cluster data. In this tutorial, you will learn how to backing up and restoring a Kubernetes cluster state stored in etcd. This will help you get familiar with the steps involved in backing up Kubernetes data.

In this tutorial, I’m going to backup an existing Etcd cluster, clear existing data and restore.

Back Up the etcd Data
Look up the value for the key cluster.name in the etcd cluster:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get cluster.name \   
--endpoints=https://<ETCD_NODE_PRIVATE_IP>:<PORT> \   
--cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \   
--cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \   
--key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
Since my cluster.name key’s value is chamod. The returned value should be chamod.

If you are lazy to pass cacerts, certs and key like this you can setup them as ENV variables and use. Find more details here

Then, Back up etcd using etcdctl and the provided etcd certificates:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db --endpoints=<ETCD_NODE_PRIVATE_IP>:<PORT> \   
--cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \   
--cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \   
--key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
Reset etcd by removing all existing etcd data from the cluster:

sudo systemctl stop etcd
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
Restore the etcd Data from the Backup
Restore the etcd data from the backup (this command spins up a temporary etcd cluster, saving the data from the backup file to a new data directory in the same location where the previous data directory was):

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \   
--initial-cluster etcd-restore=<ETCD_NODE_PRIVATE_IP>:<PORT> \   
--initial-advertise-peer-urls <ETCD_NODE_PRIVATE_IP>:<PORT> \   
--name etcd-restore \   
--data-dir /var/lib/etcd
Set ownership on the new data directory:

sudo chown -R etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
Start etcd:

sudo systemctl start etcd
Verify the restored data is present by looking up the value for the key cluster.nameagain:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get cluster.name \   
--endpoints=<ETCD_NODE_PRIVATE_IP>:<PORT> \   
--cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \   
--cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \   
--key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key

The returned value should be chamod.
